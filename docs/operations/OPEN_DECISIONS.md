# Ponte Trade Open Decisions

Purpose: a compact register of unresolved owner decisions that materially affect product, engineering, data, security, operations or go-to-market work.

This is not a backlog. Include only decisions that require owner direction or that block a meaningful next step.

## Status values

- `OPEN` — owner decision required.
- `DECIDED` — decision made; link the canonical record.
- `CANCELLED` — no longer relevant; state why.

## OD-001 — Protect the migration ledger

**Status:** OPEN  
**Owner:** Giuseppe Funaro  
**Urgency:** Immediate

### Decision required

Approve an additive production migration that enables RLS on `public.schema_migrations`, revokes anon/authenticated privileges and preserves privileged migration tooling.

### Current evidence

The table is publicly readable and writable through the anon role. Existing rows must be preserved.

### Recommended decision

Approve the security migration, privileged-path verification and post-change anonymous SELECT/INSERT refusal tests.

## OD-002 — Unexplained migration-ledger backfill

**Status:** OPEN  
**Owner:** Giuseppe Funaro  
**Urgency:** High

### Decision required

After log investigation, decide whether the 26 rows inserted at 2026-07-28 13:37:42 UTC should remain annotated as reconciliation-only evidence or be repaired through a documented ledger process.

### Constraint

Do not delete or rewrite the rows before preserving evidence and attempting attribution.

## OD-003 — Supabase Preview integration

**Status:** OPEN  
**Owner:** Giuseppe Funaro  
**Urgency:** Medium

### Decision required

Choose whether to unlink/disable the Supabase GitHub App check that points to inaccessible project reference `kltuzbxnldtmdfhakphv`.

### Recommended decision

Disable or unlink it until the repository contains a reproducible production baseline and a valid preview-database strategy.

## OD-004 — Production base-schema provenance

**Status:** OPEN  
**Owner:** Giuseppe Funaro  
**Urgency:** High

### Decision required

Approve creation of a sanitised schema-only production baseline covering the 29 production tables not represented by repository migrations.

### Constraint

The baseline must contain no production data, credentials, secrets or personal information and must be clearly labelled as a baseline snapshot, not a migration to rerun against production.

## OD-005 — Existing Market Signals classification

**Status:** OPEN  
**Owner:** Giuseppe Funaro  
**Urgency:** Product priority after database security

### Decision required

Choose the classification and backfill strategy for the existing Market Signals inventory now that the category schema is live.

### Current state

The schema is available, but historical records remain unclassified; category filters therefore report `nothing_classified`.
