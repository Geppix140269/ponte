# Ponte Trade Operations Log

Purpose: the compact, chronological operating memory for production changes, material implementation outcomes, decisions, risks and immediate next actions.

This file does not replace product authorities, ADRs, `CURRENT-STATE.md`, `DATABASE-STATE.md` or implementation plans. It links operational reality across them so a new agent does not need to reconstruct the project from chat history.

## Operating rule

Add or update an entry whenever work materially changes production, deployment, database state, architecture, security, operating process or a cross-agent handoff. Keep entries factual, concise and evidence-based.

Use this structure:

- **Completed** — what actually happened.
- **Decisions** — owner-approved operational decisions.
- **Risks / discrepancies** — unresolved operational concerns.
- **Next** — the smallest ordered set of actions.
- **Evidence** — PRs, commits, migrations, production checks or canonical documents.

## 2026-07-28 — Market classification schema and migration audit

### Completed

- PR #70 merged to `main` at merge commit `877448bd6c47aaa74e6c6eee50b1ba1f8386cafb`.
- Production Supabase project confirmed as `cptglsmjmzcfpjndqfmc` (`Ponte Trade`, eu-west-1).
- Migration `20260728a_market_classification.sql` applied to production and recorded.
- Verified in production: 17 columns, 10 CHECK constraints and 9 indexes.
- Product, Trade Services and Distribution database write paths were verified in rolled-back transactions; no test rows remained.
- Market classification coverage now reports `nothing_classified`, not `columns_absent`.
- Historical migration reconciliation completed read-only: 40 repository migration files, 0 missing schema migrations, 0 partially applied migrations, 1 superseded migration and 4 data-only migrations whose historical execution cannot be proved from schema alone.
- Application code was checked against production objects; no referenced database object was absent.

### Decisions

- Do not replay historical migrations merely because a ledger entry is absent.
- Do not backfill or classify the historical Market Signals inventory as part of the schema migration.
- Treat repository migration files, the migration ledger and the actual production schema as separate evidence sources.
- Do not relink Supabase Preview until the repository can reproduce the production base schema reliably.

### Risks / discrepancies

- `public.schema_migrations` was found publicly readable and writable through the anon role; this is an urgent security and migration-governance defect.
- Twenty-six migration-ledger rows were inserted in bulk at 2026-07-28 13:37:42 UTC by an unidentified actor or process. The entries are not independent proof that the migrations ran.
- Production contains 29 tables without repository migration provenance; the existing migration chain is not a complete production rebuild path.
- The Supabase GitHub App check points to project reference `kltuzbxnldtmdfhakphv`, which is not accessible in the account holding the production project and has produced persistent failed checks.

### Next

1. Merge PR #73 after confirming it remains documentation-only and records the production migration evidence accurately.
2. Review PR #64 and merge only if it contains solely the intended retirement of an obsolete permanently failing check.
3. Create, review and apply an additive migration that protects `public.schema_migrations` by enabling RLS and revoking anon/authenticated privileges while preserving privileged migration tooling.
4. Investigate the 2026-07-28 13:37:42 UTC ledger backfill using available logs; preserve existing rows during the investigation.
5. Capture a sanitised schema-only production baseline for the 29 unprovenanced tables.
6. Decide whether to disable the invalid Supabase Preview GitHub App integration until reproducible preview databases are possible.
